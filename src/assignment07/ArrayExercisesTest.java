/*
 * A collection of unit tests for Assignment #7.  To make this work, you'll need to 
 * follow a few steps to get JUnit tests set up in your project.
 * 
 *     Find an @Test annotation above one of the functions below.
 *     It should be in red indicating that JUnit5 is not installed.
 *     Hover over it, and it will suggest JUnit4 along with more options.
 *     Do not install JUnit4.  Instead, look at the additional suggested
 *     options and select to install JUnit5.  Follow the prompts and
 *     JUnit5 will be installed for you.
 *
 *     That's it!  You should not need to adjust dependencies or
 *     install additional tools.  (Installing JUnit5 can be complex,
 *     but the above strategy is simple.)
 *
 *     I've already imported the needed classes (and functions) for
 *     JUnit5 assertions.  See below.

	 * The unit test library provides functions for 'asserting' correctness.

	 * unit test library throws an exception and records a failure.

	 * There are other assert functions in the unit test library that are
	 * useful for noting errors.  If the function below completes without
	 * recording a failure, then the test is marked as a success.

	/* I wanted two unit tests for my function.  The first one, above,
	 *   just makes sure the basic operation of 'randomArray' is 
	 *   correct.  This second unit test makes sure the 'randomness'
	 *   is correct.  A truly random shuffle has equal likelihood
	 *   of any outcome.  I repeatedly generate random arrays,
	 *   then I count up results, and then check to make
	 *   sure that each outcome occurred with similar probability.
	 *   
	 * Because random numbers may produce results
	 *   that look uneven, I loop many times to reduce the likelihood
	 *   of random results looking like an error. 
	 *   
	 * I do not expect students to study this code - it is poor code.
	 *   (I don't like the way I'm counting permutations.)  There
	 *   are better ways, but you haven't seen the required lectures
	 *   yet, so I'm using a more primitive solution.  I expect your
	 *   unit tests to be much less complex.
